# Creating Simple Sounds
In this post we will cover getting a project set up and start laying down the groundwork for generating sound in the Unity Engine. The [previous post](/2022/unity-audio-generation-fundamentals) covered a basic understanding on what digital sound is, and also provided some insight into the vocabulary we will be referencing. If you have never dealt with digital sound manipulation before, it may be worth your time to go back and take a look.

## Project Setup
Create a new Unity project. The editor used in this post is version **2020.3.19f1**.

Unity comes with a BUNCH of preinstalled packages in the [package manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-ui@1.8/manual/index.html). For the sake of keeping things clean, we will remove pretty much all of them, and only add ones we know we will need right now.

One big thing that we need to install is the [**Unity Burst Compiler**](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.burst@0.2-preview.20/). The burst compiler is some voodoo magic that takes standard C# IL/.NET bytecode and compiles it down to *REALLY* fast native code. We will be using this heavily to generate sounds because performance is *critical* when generating sounds at runtime.

The only other package I have is one for my specific <abbr data-title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr>, which happens to be [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/). You dont *need* to use this IDE, but it's my IDE of choice.

With our editor up and running, lets start hooking into the sound engine.

## Hooking into the sound engine
Unity's MonoBehaviour allows for a method called `OnAudioFilterRead`. This is usually used to process incoming audio, but nothing is stopping us from *creating* audio in the first place.

Let's create a new MonoBehaviour and call it `SynthOut`, and add the filter method. This takes in a `float` array and an `int` to represent the number of channels.

We will create chains of sound generators and filters, but this class will ultimately be the point where the sound gets inserted back into Unity's built-in sound engine.

```csharp
public class SynthOut : MonoBehaviour
{
    private void OnAudioFilterRead(float[] data, int channels)
    {
        // sound generation logic goes here
    }
}
```

The `float` array is what we call an audio buffer. This contains the samples for the next section of audio playing in Unity's sound engine. This should currently be set to have **2048** samples. This is because, by default, unity's buffer length is 1024, and there are 2 audio channels *(one for left and right)*.

The order of the data when in 2 channel mode is an interleaving of the samples as a left right repeating pattern *(other modes follow a similar paradigm just with more channels)*:

Now that we have an entry point into the sound engine, and understand the data layout, let's build a system around it to make it easy to expand into many types of sounds.

## Establishing an architecture

### Native Buffers
Since we are using the burst compiler, we cannot be passing around managed objects into Burst Compiled methods. Unfortunately this includes arrays, including `float[]`.

We know we need performance and will have to use something other than managed arrays. You also my know of a struct called `NativeArray`, but this is unfortunately only able to be used in jobs, not burst compiled methods.

So lets make our own struct that allocates native memory for us called `BufferHandler`. This can be used in many places, so we will keep it generic for now. We have to be very careful to dispose these though because they could leave unmanaged memory on the heap if we aren't careful.

```csharp
[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]
public unsafe struct BufferHandler<T> : IDisposable where T : unmanaged
{
    public int RawLength { get; }
    public T* Pointer { get; private set; }
    public bool Allocated => (IntPtr) Pointer != IntPtr.Zero;

    public BufferHandler(int rawLength)
    {
        RawLength = rawLength;
        Pointer = (T*) UnsafeUtility.Malloc(RawLength * sizeof(T), 
            UnsafeUtility.AlignOf<T>(), Allocator.Persistent);
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        if (!Allocated) return;
        UnsafeUtility.Free(Pointer, Allocator.Persistent);
        Pointer = (T*) IntPtr.Zero;
    }
}
```

Let's also create a wrapper for this object that will be our `SynthBuffer`. We will store data in here about the properties of the buffer as well.

```csharp
public struct SynthBuffer : IDisposable
{
    public int Channels { get; }
    public int BufferLength { get; }
    public int ChannelLength { get; }
    public BufferHandler<float> Handler { get; }

    public SynthBuffer(int bufferLength, int channels)
    {
        Channels = channels;
        BufferLength = bufferLength;
        ChannelLength = bufferLength / channels;
        Handler = new BufferHandler<float>(BufferLength);
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Handler.Dispose();
    }
}
```
